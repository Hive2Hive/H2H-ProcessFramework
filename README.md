# Hive2Hive - Process Framework
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Hive2Hive/ProcessFramework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Hive2Hive/ProcessFramework)

This is a lightweight and extensible framework for asynchronous and synchronous process composition. Initially started and used as a sub-module of [Hive2Hive](https://github.com/Hive2Hive/Hive2Hive), an open-source Java library for secure, distributed, P2P-based file synchronization and sharing, this framework now is a standalone module that might be helpful for your projects, too. It's licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and any contribution is welcome.

## Features
- simple, straightforward API
- **supports**:
 - *rollback*
 - *result computation*
 - *pause/resume*
 - *asynchronous execution/rollback*
- **easily extendable** due to the use of [GoF Design Patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns):
  - all components have the same API
  - processes can be built by using a [Composite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern):
    - use default containers or define your own
    - define your own process steps
    - process trees can be built by **nesting components** (containers, steps)
  - processes can be extended by **adding behaviour/state** by using a [Decorator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern):
    - use default decorators or define your own
  
## API Demonstration

The following code shows the most fundamental things that can be done with the framework.

**Creating a `ProcessStep`**

Simply inherit from the abstract class `ProcessStep<T>`, where `T` is the type of the result, and implement `doExecute()` (and `doRollback()`). (Tip: `T` can also be `Void`.)
```java
public class MyProcessStep extends ProcessStep<Integer> {

	@Override
	protected Integer doExecute() throws InvalidProcessStateException, ProcessExecutionException {
		
		// do some stuff...
		int result = 1 + 2 + 3;
		
		// tag for rollback
		setRequiresRollback(true);
		
		return result;
	}

	@Override
	protected Integer doRollback() throws InvalidProcessStateException, ProcessRollbackException {
		
		// rollback stuff...
		int result = 0;
		
		// untag for rollback
		setRequiresRollback(false);
		
		return result;
	}
}
```
**Execution and Rollback**

Then, the above created step can be executed and its result retrieved as follows. In case of an execution error, it could directly be rolled back.
```java
ProcessStep<Integer> step1 = new MyProcessStep();

int result;
try {
   result = step1.execute();
} catch (ProcessExecutionException ex) {
   result = step1.rollback();
}
```
**Asynchronous Components**

Every `IProcessComponent<T>` can be wrapped with the `AsyncComponent` decorator. With this, the component's execution and rollback run on a separate thread and immediately return control to the caller.
```java
ProcessStep<Integer> step2 = new MyProcessStep();
IProcessComponent<Future<Integer>> asyncStep2 = new AsyncComponent<Integer>(step2);

Future<Integer> futureResult = asyncStep2.execute();
```
Note: Dealing with asynchronous components might be a bit tricky. Make sure to take a look at our [Wiki Example](https://github.com/Hive2Hive/ProcessFramework/wiki/Correct-usage-of-AsyncComponent) to be sure to use it correctly.

**Process Composition**

Classes inheriting from `ProcessComposition<T>` allow to nest `IProcessComponent`s and to build process trees. The below example shows the usage of the default `SyncProcess`.
```java
ProcessComposite<Void> composite1 = new SyncProcess();
ProcessComposite<Void> composite2 = new SyncProcess();

composite1.add(step1);       // add a single ProcessStep
composite1.add(asyncStep2);  // add an async component
composite1.add(composite2);  // add another ProcessComposite
```
Now, we ***could*** make the whole composite run asynchronously.
```java
IProcessComponent<Future<Void>> asyncComposite = new AsyncComponent<Void>(composite1);

try {
  // execute composite sync
  composite.execute();
	
  // or async
  asyncComposite.execute();

} catch (ProcessExecutionException ex) {
	
  // rollback composite sync
  composite.execute();

  // or async
  asyncComposite.rollback();
}
```
**Pause and Resume**

`IProcessComponent<T>`s that are wrapped with the `AsyncComponent` decorator can be paused/resumed because they run asynchronously.
```java
asyncComposite.execute();
asyncComposite.pause();

// do other stuff meanwhile...

asyncComposite.resume();
```

## Architecture
### Class Diagram
![Class Diagram](http://hive2hive.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Process-Framework-Extracted.png)
The most essential elements are the following:
- `IProcessComponent<T>`: Basic interface for all process components. Defines all common functionality. `T` is the type of the result computed by this `IProcessComponent`.
- `ProcessComponent<T>`: Abstract base class for all process components. Keeps track of a process components' most essential properties and functionalities.
- `ProcessStep<T>`: Abstract base class for all normal `IProcessComponent`s (leaf). These normal components represent a specific operation and do not contain other `IProcessComponent`s.
- `ProcessComposite<T>`: Abstract base class for all composite `IProcessComponent`s. These composites contain other `IProcessComponent`s.
- `ProcessDecorator<T>`: Abstract base class for all decorators that decorate `IProcessComponent`s. These decorators provide additional behavior or state to existing implementations of `IProcessComponent`s.

### Process States
The graphic depicts the state transitions that are valid for all `IProcessComponent`s. In case some component tries to enter an invalid state, an `InvalidProcessStateException` will be thrown.

## Installation
There are three easy ways to get and include the Hive2Hive Process Framework into your project.

If you just want to use the framework, either refer to option 1 or 2.  
If you want to [contribute to the project](#contribution), please refer to option 3.
- **Option 1: Add Maven dependency** *(recommended)*  
  You can add the latest stable release as an [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) dependency and fetch it from our repository. Add the following to your `pom.xml` and make sure to select the most recent version.  
```xml
  <repository>
    <id>hive2hive.org</id>
    <url>http://repo.hive2hive.org</url>
  </repository>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.hive2hive</groupId>
    <artifactId>org.hive2hive.processframework</artifactId>
    <version>1.X</version>
  </dependency>
```
- **Option 2: Add JAR-file directly**  
  In case you don't want to use Maven, you can just download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/Hive2Hive/ProcessFramework/releases). The required `.jar`-files is packed and delivered to you as a `.zip`.
- **Option 3: Clone from GitHub**  
  If you want to contribute to the Hive2Hive ProcessFramework project, this is what you should do. Cloning from the `dev` branch allows yout to get the *bleeding edge* of development. This option is not recommended if you just want to use the library.

## Documentation

# Hive2Hive - Process Framework
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Hive2Hive/ProcessFramework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Hive2Hive/ProcessFramework)

This is a Java library for asynchronous and synchronous process composition. Its licensed under the MIT License and any contribution is welcome.

Initially, this project was started and used as a sub-module of [Hive2Hive](https://github.com/Hive2Hive/Hive2Hive), an open-source Java library for secure, distributed, P2P-based file synchronization and sharing.
But due to its simplicity and generic form, we received a lot of positive feedback from people that also thought about using it. So we decided to provide it as a separate module such that it might be helpful for your projects, too.
